NProgress
=========

Slim progress bars for Ajax'y applications. Inspired by Google, YouTube, and Medium.

# Installation
Add jQuery (1.8 or above), [nprogress.js] and [nprogress.css] to your project.

# Basic usage
Simply call `start()` and `done()` to control the progress bar.

```javascript
NProgress.start();
NProgress.done();
```

# Ideas
 * Add progress to your Ajax calls! Bind it to the jQuery `ajaxStart` and
 `ajaxStop` events.

 * Make a fancy loading bar even without Turbolinks/Pjax! Bind it to
 `$(document).ready` and `$(window).load`.

# Advanced usage

__Percentages:__ To set a progress percentage, call `.set(n)`, where *n* is a
number between `0..1`.

```javascript
NProgress.set(0.0);     // Sorta same as .start()
NProgress.set(0.4);
NProgress.set(1.0);     // Sorta same as .done()
```

__Incrementing:__ To increment the progress bar, just use `.inc()`. This
increments it with a random amount. This will never get to 100%: use it for
every image load (or similar).

```javascript
NProgress.inc();
```

__Force-done:__ By passing `true` to `done()`, it will show the progress bar
even if it's not being shown. (The default behavior is that *.done()* will not
    do anything if *.start()* isn't called)

```javascript
NProgress.done(true);
```

# Configuration
Change the minimum percentage using `minimum`.

```javascript
NProgress.configure({ minimum: 0.1 });
```

You can change the markup using `template`. To keep the progress
bar working, keep an element with `role='bar'` in there.

```javascript
NProgress.configure({
  template: "<div class='....'>...</div>"
});
```

Adjust animation settings using `ease` (a CSS easing string) and `speed` (in 
    ms).

```javascript
NProgress.configure({ ease: 'ease', speed: 500 });
```

Want to turn off trickling? Set `trickle` to `false`.

```javascript
NProgress.configure({ trickle: false });
```

You can adjust the `trickleRate` (how much to increase per trickle) and 
`trickleSpeed` (how often to trickle, in ms).

```javascript
NProgress.configure({ trickleRate: 0.02, trickleSpeed: 800 });
```

Want to turn off loading spinner? Set `showSpinner` to `false`.

```javascript
NProgress.configure({ showSpinner: false });
```

# Customization
Just edit `nprogress.css` to your liking. Tip: you probably only want to find
and replace occurances of `#29d`.

The included CSS file is pretty minimal... in fact, feel free to scrap it and
make your own!
