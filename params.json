{"name":"NProgress-X","tagline":"Slim progress bars that you can append to any part of your DOM.","body":"# Introduction\r\nI came across [Rico Sta. Cruz](http://ricostacruz.com)'s awesome [NProgress](http://github.com/rstacruz) while searching the web for cool tools to improve the \r\nlooks and responsiveness of the web application my colleague [codecoding](http://github.com/codecoding) and I were working on at the time. \r\nWe had many many screens that displayed multiple controls which loaded data dynamically through AJAX requests. All these controls were\r\nindependent from one another, and we thought it would be cool to display an animated progress bar on top of each of them. So we took \r\n[Rico Sta. Cruz](http://ricostacruz.com)'s [NProgress](http://github.com/rstacruz), forked it, refactored it, added to it, and created our very own \r\nNProgress-X: a progress bar that you can append to any part of your DOM.\r\n\r\nNOTE: NProgress-X is so different to the original NProgress (and purposely so) that I have never thought of doing a pull request on GitHub, and never will.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nAdd jQuery (1.8 or above), [nprogress.js] and [nprogress.css] to your project.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Basic usage\r\nI refactored the original NProgress mainly for the purpose of having multiple instances of it at once on the same page, so NProgress-X must be instantiated in order to be used. Like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar np = new NProgress();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Configuration\r\nI've kept most of the original settings and added a few more. Check them out.\r\n\r\n### minimum\r\nMinimum percentage of increment. Default value is 0.05.\r\n\r\n### easing\r\nCSS easing string for the animation settings. Default value is 'ease'.\r\n\r\n### speed\r\nAnimation speed in milliseconds. Default value is 200.\r\n\r\n### trickle\r\nSet to false to turn off the trickling (automatic progress increment). True by default.\r\n\r\n### trickleRate\r\nHow much to increase per trickle. Default value is 0.02.\r\n\r\n### trickleSpeed\r\nHow often to trickle, in milliseconds. Default value is 800.\r\n\r\n### container\r\njQuery selector of the container DOM element. The progress bar will be PREPENDED TO this container (this means it will be inserted as the first child of the container element). \r\nIf you do not set this parameter -or if you use the selector 'body'- the progress bar will be inserted BEFORE the body (on the very top of the page).\r\n\r\n### renderOnInit\r\nSet to true to render the progress bar upon instantiation (though it will remain hidden until the progress is set). False by default.\r\n\r\n### removeOnFinish\r\nSet to true to remove the progress bar from the DOM when it reaches 100%. If you're gonna be reusing it a lot, you might as well leave it there -hidden- rather than creating it\r\nevery time you want to display it. True by default.\r\n\r\n### randomTrickle\r\nSet to true to use random trickle increments. False by default.\r\n\r\n### startOnInit\r\nSet to true to start running the progress bar's progress upon instantiation. False by default.\r\n\r\n### template\r\nHTML markup used to render the progress bar. To keep the progress bar working, keep an element with `role='bar'` in there.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar np = new NProgress({\r\n\tminimum: 0.08,\r\n\teasing: 'linear',\r\n\tspeed: 500,\r\n\ttrickle: true,\r\n\ttrickleRate: 0.05,\r\n\ttrickleSpeed: 500,\r\n\tcontainer: '#divContainer',\r\n\trenderOnInit: true,\r\n\tremoveOnFinish: false,\r\n\tstartOnInit: true,\r\n\ttemplate: '<div class=\"foo\" role=\"bar\"></div>'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Methods\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Ideas\r\n * Add progress to your Ajax calls! Bind it to the jQuery `ajaxStart` and\r\n `ajaxStop` events.\r\n\r\n * Make a fancy loading bar even without Turbolinks/Pjax! Bind it to\r\n `$(document).ready` and `$(window).load`.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Customization\r\nJust edit `nprogress.css` to your liking. Tip: you probably only want to find\r\nand replace occurances of `#29d`.\r\n\r\nThe included CSS file is pretty minimal... in fact, feel free to scrap it and\r\nmake your own!\r\n\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgements\r\nGive credit where it's due!\r\n\r\nThe original [NProgress](http://github.com/rstacruz) is authored and maintained by [Rico Sta.
